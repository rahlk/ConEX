I plan to develop a framework that can be easily instantiated to create a
configuration exploration tool for any configurable software system.

Although the current implementation can also be easily modified to create a
tool for other systems, it's not so easy to do so.

This is on-going...I will update it as I modifying the current tool to make a
Spark configuration exploration tool.
